Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.
"US stocks rose early Tuesday as investors considered the latest developments on President Trump's tariffs, including a potential auto sector reprieve and a concrete step toward new semiconductor and pharmaceutical duties."
"The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose 0.4% in early trading, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) advanced 0.3%."
"On Monday, US stocks rose on the heels of a remarkably volatile week for markets following news the Trump administration would treat tariffs on key electronics separately from duties on specific countries and would impose them at a later date. The president also floated possible tariff exemptions for car companies, sending auto stocks soaring."
But any clarity emerging on Trump's trade continued to remain elusive as the president simultaneously pushed forward with plans to place tariffs on pharmaceutical and semiconductor imports.

"On Tuesday, in addition to staying vigilant on the trade front, investors assessed a slew of corporate earnings, including results from Bank of America (BAC), Citi (C), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), and PNC (PNC)."
Boeing (BA) stock fell around 2% in early trading Tuesday after Bloomberg News reported that China instructed its airlines to suspend additional Boeing jet deliveries.
Traders will remain vigilant for any early signs of how tariff turmoil might affect companies' bottom lines as well as what — if any — guidance they can provide for future quarters.
Shares of Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co. (HPE) jumped as much as 9% Tuesday after news broke that activist investor Elliott Investment Management reportedly built a position worth more than $1.5 billion in the company.
Shares jumped as high as 8% but retreated to a gain of around 5% by the afternoon.
Per Bloomberg:
"Elliott plans to engage with the software and networking company to help it boost value, said the people, who asked to not be identified because the details aren’t public. The investment makes Elliott one of the company’s top five shareholders, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Elliott’s exact intentions at HPE couldn’t be immediately learned."
Elliott’s move is one of the first major activist campaigns unveiled after the market turmoil related to the President Donald Trump’s tariff plans.
"While artificial intelligence has fueled heavy demand for hardware such as servers and networking, HPE hasn’t been able to seize on the moment as much as its peers including Dell Technologies Inc. The stock is down about 30% since the start of the year"
Stocks moved higher Tuesday despite downbeat news on trade negotiations from the European Union (EU).
"Trade talks between the EU and US reportedly made ""little progress"" over the past several days. Officials indicated the duties imposed on the EU would remain once President Trump's ""reciprocal"" tariff pause resumes."
Per Bloomberg:
"The EU’s trade chief, Maros Sefcovic, left the meeting with little clarity on the US stance, struggling to determine the American side’s aims, according to people familiar with the discussions. He met for about two hours with US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and Trade Representative Jamieson Greer in Washington Monday."
"The US officials indicated that the 20% “reciprocal” tariffs — which have been reduced to 10% for 90 days — as well as other tariffs targeting sectors including cars and metals would not be removed outright, said the people, who spoke on the condition of anonymity."
Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer reports:
The fallout from President Trump's tariff announcements and revisions hasn't yet pushed investors to shy away from an old habit: buying the dip.
"Data from VandaTrack showed the week following ""Liberation Day"" saw ""record dip-buying flows from retail investors,"" including $3 billion in net purchases on April 3, the largest daily total since VandaTrack began collecting this data in 2014."
"Global markets sold off sharply in the initial reaction to Trump's reciprocal tariff announcements that pushed levies to their highest level in a century. Across trading on April 3 and 4, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) experienced one of its worst two-day stretches in history."
"Since this initial crash, markets have remained volatile, with the index seeing its best single-day rally since 2008 last Wednesday, April 9."
Read more here.
"As markets attempt to return to normalcy, recent trading action has been mixed."
"According to data compiled by Yahoo Finance, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is up two straight days with 85% of components in the green. Still, the benchmark index has formed a ""death cross"" technical pattern — a bearish analysis in which the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day moving average."
This often signals the potential for a major sell-off or downward trend.
"Meanwhile, the US bond market and the dollar (DX=F), which aggressively sold off last week, have been consolidating recent moves with Wall Street's ""fear gauge index"" (^VIX) briefly dipping below 30."
"Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is edging higher in early trade, trading just below $86,000 a coin. Gold (GC=F) continues to surge above $3,200 an ounce, trading at record highs."
US stocks rose early Tuesday as investors continued to digest the latest trade policy headlines after a tumultuous week for stocks following back-and-forth tariff shocks from the Trump administration.
"The benchmark S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) each opened about 0.2% higher, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rose around 0.1%."
From Reuters:
"U.S. import prices unexpectedly fell in March, pulled down by decreasing costs for energy products, but the trend is unlikely to be sustained amid an escalation in trade tensions."
"Import prices dipped 0.1% last month after a downwardly revised 0.2% gain in February, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said on Tuesday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast import prices, which exclude tariffs, unchanged following a previously reported 0.4% increase in February."
"The report joined weak consumer and producer price data in suggesting that inflation was subsiding before President Donald Trump's broad tariffs on imports came into effect. The import duties, which have triggered a damaging trade war with China and plunged financial markets into turmoil, have stoked fears of high inflation and tepid growth or even a recession."

Stock futures slid below the flat line an hour ahead of the opening bell as investors await new sector tariffs — or reprieves — from the Trump administration and earnings season picks up momentum.
Here are some of the trending tickers in premarket trading we have our eyes on:
On the earnings front:
Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) stock edged higher after the company reported better-than-expected first quarter results and raised its sales forecast for the full year. J&J CFO Joe Wolk said the company expects a $400 million profit hit from the tariffs that are currently in place.
"Albertsons (ACI) stock sank 5% after the grocery chain's annual profit forecast came in below estimates, weighed down by tariffs and their potential to dent consumer demand. Susan Morris, the current COO, will take over as CEO in May."
Bank of America (BAC) stock rose 1.7% after the Wall Street bank reported a jump in profits and trading in the first quarter.
Citigroup (C) also reported a surge in profits in the first quarter. The stock popped about 2%.
In other news:
Boeing (BA) sank more than 3% after Beijing instructed Chinese airlines to stop taking deliveries of Boeing jets in the latest escalation of the US-China trade war.
"Netflix (NFLX) stock rose 2% after the Wall Street Journal reported it has ambitious plans to reach a $1 trillion valuation and double its revenue by 2030. Netflix, considered the winner of the streaming wars, will report earnings on Thursday."
Bank of America (BAC) stock rose 2% in premarket trading after the bank reported a jump in profits in the first quarter amid market volatility.
"Like the other Wall Street banks that reported quarterly results — JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) — Bank of America saw a pullback in investment banking but a rise in trading revenue."
Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith has the details:
"CEO Brian Moynihan said Moynihan said “our business clients have been performing well; and consumers have shown resilience, continuing to spend and maintaining healthy credit quality.”"
"But ""we potentially face a changing economy in the future"" — a nod to the uncertainties ahead as some of Trump's more aggressive tariffs are still in question."
"Total sales and trading revenue for the country's second-largest bank was up 9% from the year-ago period to $5.66 billion, its highest quarterly haul in more than a decade. Bank of America's revenue just from trading equities was up 17% to $2.2 billion, reaching the highest ever for one quarter."
Total profits for Bank of America were $7.4 billion. That figure was 11% higher than a year ago and exceeded what analysts expected. Its stock was up in pre-market trading.

"In today's Morning Brief, Yahoo Finance's Hamza Shaban writes that the most important distinction for Big Tech isn't just size, it's whether they can get a tariff carve-out:"
It pays to be big.
"That's one early takeaway from the tariff drama. Investors momentarily poured back into Big Tech after the administration initiated a temporary levy exemption that covers consumer electronics, networking equipment, GPUs, and servers."
"It's essentially another way of saying Big Tech will probably be OK, as investors also look to the sector as a defensive play. Meanwhile, other sectors and companies still stare down a massive tariff upheaval."
"Overall, the dizzying tariff news, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said in a note to clients, is ""a step forward net positive for Apple as well as other tech names."" It creates the space for some sort of negotiation with China, he said, and can lead to a deescalation of the trade war issues that have left Big Tech caught in the middle."
"Their importance for American tech supremacy means in a way they are too important to fail, and the value they bring to the stock market makes the rest of the S&P seem like lesser moons in a solar system that revolves around them."

China orders halts to Boeing jet deliveries: Bloomberg News
Trump floats possible exemption on auto-part tariffs
Global electric vehicle sales up 29% in March
"Boeing (BA) stock dropped more than 2% in premarket trading on Tuesday after reports emerged that China has ordered its airlines to halt further deliveries of Boeing jets, according to Bloomberg News."
"This move marks the latest escalation in what Yahoo Finance's Senior Columnist Rick Newman refers to as the ""giant trade war"" that has unfolded between the US and China. As Newman highlights in his latest piece, this conflict, which initially began with targeted tariffs, has now morphed into a full-scale trade war, with China as the primary adversary and smaller skirmishes occurring with other nations."
"This tit-for-tat escalation has significantly impacted industries, especially those reliant on global supply chains. The Boeing delivery halt is just one example of how the trade war continues to ripple through various sectors, with repercussions felt by businesses and consumers alike."
"Asian markets rallied, with Japan leading the surge, after President Donald Trump signaled a possible halt to planned auto tariffs—easing investor nerves already soothed by the decision to delay duties on certain consumer tech products."
Bloomberg reports
"Indexes in Japan rose more than 1% with companies such as Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co. jumping. Shares in China and Hong Kong fluctuated while futures contracts for the US and Europe pared earlier losses. Treasuries climbed, and a gauge of the dollar edged higher to trim some of its decline on Monday."
"Markets are consolidating as the exemptions raised hopes there may be room for negotiations after the president’s reciprocal tariffs this month wiped $10 trillion off global equities and spurred a rout in Treasuries. Still, the flip-flops are keeping investors on edge and business leaders including JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Jamie Dimon have warned that Trump’s effort to remake the global trading order may push the US into a recession."
"“Trump’s showing signs of flexibility around his tariff policies, and that’s brought some composure back to the market,” said Yusuke Sakai, a senior trader at T&D Asset Management."
Read more here.
"Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM), has sold roughly $31.5 million in stock of America's largest bank. The sale is his second offload of stock since taking the role of CEO in 2005."
"JPMorgan, the largest U.S. lender, last week surpassed its first-quarter profit estimates on record equities trading and higher fees from debt underwriting and advising on mergers."
Dimon's 2024 pay package went up 8.3% to $39 million.
"The filing on Monday said Dimon sold 133,639 shares."
"The share sale comes as JPMorgan prepares for an eventual leadership transition. Dimon, 69, is one of the most influential figures on Wall Street and has run the bank for 19 years."
"The bank's board has said it is focused on the succession planning, which Dimon said last year is his most important task."

"Bank of America (BAC) and Citigroup (C) reported first quarter increases in profits and revenue driven by robust trading results, becoming the latest big banks to benefit from the market volatility triggered by the start of President Trump’s tariff rollout in February and March."
"Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan acknowledged in a statement Tuesday that ""we potentially face a changing economy in the future"" — a nod to the uncertainties ahead as some of Trump's more aggressive tariffs are still in question — but he also told analysts the bank's research team doesn't see a recession happening in 2025."
"US consumers, according to the bank's data, keep ""pushing money into the economy"" and the lender's business clients ""remain profitable, liquid and have strong results."""
"""We continue to watch for signs the environment [is] actually changing,"" Moynihan added."
"Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser also nodded to Trump's trade war in her Tuesday earnings statement, noting that ""when all is said and done, and longstanding trade imbalances and other structural shifts are behind us, the U.S. will still be the world’s leading economy, and the dollar will remain the reserve currency."""
"At Bank of America, total sales and trading revenue for the country's second-largest bank rose 9% from the year-ago period to $5.66 billion, its highest quarterly haul in more than a decade. Bank of America's revenue just from trading equities was up 17% to $2.2 billion, its highest ever for one quarter."
"Citigroup's sales and trading revenue rose 12% from the year-ago period to $6 billion, with Citi also notching its highest quarter ever for equity trading."
"JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) also reported jumps in trading amid market volatility during the first quarter. Together, the big five banks on Wall Street pulled in nearly $37 billion on that front."
"At the same time, some banks showed a slight pullback in investment banking, as companies became more cautious about new deals amid the uncertainties surrounding Trump’s trade policies. Those fees at Bank of America fell 3% from the year-ago period to $1.52 billion."
"Read more: How to protect your money during economic turmoil, stock market volatility"
"However, Citigroup reported that its investment banking fees rose 13.6% from the year-ago period to $1.1 billion. Its total profits and revenue also rose from a year ago to $4 billion and $21.6 billion, exceeding analyst expectations."
Total profits for Bank of America were $7.4 billion. That figure was 11% higher than a year ago and exceeded what analysts expected.
The stocks of Bank of America and Citigroup both rose in Tuesday morning trading.
"Bank of America CFO Alastair Borthwick told reporters, ""Our research team at this point doesn't believe we'll see a recession, and our clients continue to show encouraging signs."""
"""Our research team are still calling for modest growth,"" he added. ""They've talked about the fact that they think that some of the uncertainty may lead to a slowdown in the economy before it picks back up, but that would be very similar to things like the blue-chip consensus at this point, and similar to what Chairman Powell has said"" — referring to Fed Chair Jerome Powell."
"But there were signs that Bank of America expects credit conditions to worsen. It set aside $1.48 billion in credit provisions for potential future losses, more than 12% more than it set aside a year ago."
"Borthwick walked analysts through a comparison of the bank's balance sheet now as compared to the fourth quarter of 2009, a tumultuous period following a housing crash and financial crisis that severely tested Bank of America and the rest of the US banking system."
"He told analysts that Bank of America's capital base and liquidity have increased significantly since the end of 2009, and stress test results indicate significantly lower credit losses expected in a severe downturn."
"The changes made since that time, Moynihan said, allow the bank to ""stand tall in times of stress."""

March's report could be last time investors see inflation easing. Here's what to expect.
Unlock stock picks and a broker-level newsfeed that powers Wall Street.
US stocks edged higher on Monday as investors focused on tech's temporary reprieve from President Trump's tariffs.
"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) trimmed bigger gains to rise a healthy 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) also closed off its session high, up 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up around 0.7%, or more than 300 points."
"Trump and his top advisers have sowed confusion in recent days on the future of its tariffs on China and on specific sectors. Megacap tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) scored a significant victory over the weekend when it was revealed that the US had excluded smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics from tariffs."
"But on Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that those electronics would soon be covered under levies that he said would be separate from those imposed on specific countries."
"Trump himself added to the muddied message when he said in a lengthy Sunday post on social media that there was ""no exception"" for those products."
"""We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,"" he said."
"But the initial reprieve broadly lifted the mood: Apple (AAPL) shares gained more than 2% during Monday’s session, as its smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices were set to benefit. Meanwhile, US automakers Ford (F) and GM (GM) stocks rose as Trump hinted he may also consider a carve out for upcoming auto tariffs."
"Yet Wall Street remains braced for another week of potential tariff-fueled ups and downs. The major indexes had their best week since at least 2023 last week, though it came in anything but conventional fashion."
"Traditional ""safe-haven"" assets have come in particular focus in recent days, as longer-term Treasury yields have surged while the US dollar has weakened against foreign currencies. Yields on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) fell below 4.36% Monday, while the US dollar (DX=F) fell."

But this series of revisions hasn't yet changed one clear implication of the president's policy proposals as they stand today: We're going back in time. Way back.
Current estimates of the effective tariff rate for all US imports range from 22% to 27%.

"President Trump's wish to bring down oil prices has so far gone his way, with crude oil futures hovering near four-year lows."
And some on Wall Street think prices have a lot further to fall before the administration would be motivated to step in to support oil markets the way cascading bond prices may have been the catalyst for a 'Trump put' in the form of a pause on tariffs.

"The latest policy moves from the administration have brought uncertainty to the market, affecting various sectors, including housing. But builders like Toll Brothers (TOL), Taylor Morrison (TMHC), PulteGroup (PHM), and M/I Homes (MHO) may be positioned to weather the storm as these builders target ""move-up"" and ""active adult"" segments, a buyer group that tends to be more resilient in a high interest rate environment."
"Mortgage rates have remained volatile this week, with some measures showing rates approaching 7%. While Trump has paused new tariffs on some trading partners, China’s levies remain very high, which continues to weigh down market sentiment."
"Shares of Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI), and Lennar Corporation (LEN) were mixed during Monday’s trading, with Toll down 0.8%, Lennar off by 0.1%, and D.R. Horton up 0.4%."
Auto stocks rose on Monday after President Trump told reporters he’s considering exemptions related to imported cars and parts to give manufacturers more time to set up shop in the US.

The market rally on Monday faded by midday as the Nasdaq (^IXIC) erased almost a 2% gain to dip below the flat line.

"Meanwhile, Novo Nordisk (NVO) and Eli Lilly (LLY) stocks rose 2.5% and 1.3%, respectively. The two companies are considered leaders in the weight-loss space for their injectable versions of GLP-1 drugs."
Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani reports on Wall Street's initial reaction to the news:
The news was a surprise to Wall Street but not enough to significantly impact the stock. Pfizer's stock traded mostly flat in early Monday.
"""From here, while we anticipate shares to be down modestly, we do not think the Street was assigning any meaningful value to the asset and see limited downside given the company's current valuation,"" JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott wrote in a note to clients Monday."
"Pfizer has been under pressure to find a new blockbuster in its pipeline to fill the expected revenue drop from some of its key drugs going off patent by the end of the decade. That includes its Prevnar 13 vaccine next year and cancer drug Ibrance in 2028. Both brought in a combined $10.8 billion in 2024, with the Prevnar vaccines contributing $6.4 billion."

Apple (AAPL) shares gained as much as 5% on Monday as Wall Street viewed the iPhone maker a major winner of exemptions on tariffs announced by the Trump administration over the weekend.
"""The Trump administration gives AAPL a lifeline,"" said Angelo Zino, vice president and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""It also provides a huge sigh of relief for US consumers who feared a significant increase in costs."""
"In a big win for the technology sector, the White House carved out reciprocal tariff exemptions on smartphones, computers, memory chips, tablets/smartwatches, chip equipment, and other electronics."
"""AAPL is clearly the biggest winner across the Technology space, avoiding a worst case scenario,"" said Zino."
"Apple shares are still down 15% year to date. The stock has been volatile since President Trump's reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2. Shares subsequently climbed higher after Trump announced a 90-day pause on many countries, but increased levies on China."
"Analysts had warned of significantly higher-priced iPhones if tariffs on China remained in place. Despite the exemption, CFRA's Zino says Apple must continue to think about diversifying its manufacturing out of China."
"""We think AAPL will look to potentially double its India iPhone capacity over the next two to three years to help mitigate future China/U.S. tensions,"" said Zino."
"Tech led market gains on Monday after it was revealed over the weekend that the US had excluded smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics from tariffs."
"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose as 1.5 %, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) jumped 2%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained over 500 points."
Apple (AAPL) rose more than 5% as the iPhone maker is a top beneficiary of tariff exemptions. Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) and the rest of the 'Mag 7' stocks also gained.
"Nvidia (NVDA) announced on Monday it is ""working with its manufacturing partners to design and build factories that, for the first time, will produce NVIDIA AI supercomputers entirely in the US."""
"""Together with leading manufacturing partners, the company has commissioned more than a million square feet of manufacturing space to build and test NVIDIA Blackwell chips in Arizona and AI supercomputers in Texas,"" said Nvidia in a blog post on Monday."
"The company said NVIDIA Blackwell chips have started production at TSMC’s chip plants in Phoenix, Arizona."
"""NVIDIA is building supercomputer manufacturing plants in Texas, with Foxconn in Houston and with Wistron in Dallas. Mass production at both plants is expected to ramp up in the next 12-15 months,"" said the post."
Share of the AI giant rose in pre-market as the overall market gained
"Shares of Meta Platforms (META) advanced 1.4% just under an hour before the opening bell, as the social media giant is set to face off with the FTC in a historic antitrust case."
"The US government case, which begins Monday, could force Meta to sell Instagram and break up its $1.3 trillion empire."
Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan outlines the key arguments and what's at stake:
"If Zuckerberg is not able to convince President Trump to settle before the trial begins in a Washington, D.C., court before US judge James Boasberg, Meta will become the second Silicon Valley giant in two years to face off against the government’s antitrust watchdogs."
"The government's case against Meta centers on the Federal Trade Commission’s claims that its leading social media platform, Facebook, used monopoly power to buy up, rather than compete with, smaller rival social media companies."
"Facebook acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion and WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion. Both mergers were given a green light by the FTC, following reviews."
"Paul Swanson, a partner with Holland & Hart and head of the firm’s antitrust practice, said Judge Boasberg is clearly open to hearing the FTC’s theory, yet also skeptical of it."

"As bank earnings continue to roll in, Goldman Sachs (GS) warned about economic uncertainties ahead, offering a similar message as JPMorgan (JPM) and BlackRock (BLK),"
Yahoo Finance's David Hollerith reports:
"Investment banking fees slowed at Goldman Sachs (GS) in the first quarter even as trading volatility helped lift overall revenue and profits, the latest sign of how complicated 2025 is turning out to be for some of the biggest names on Wall Street."
"Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon warned of more challenges to come, saying in a statement Monday that ""we are entering the second quarter with a markedly different operating environment than earlier this year"" — an apparent nod to the uncertainties triggered by President Trump’s aggressive slate of new tariffs."
"Overall profits at Goldman Sachs rose 15% from the year ago period to $4.74 billion. Revenues rose 6%, to $15 billion."
"But dealmaking pulled back. Fees from investment banking dropped 8% from the year-ago period. Advisory revenues earned from helping companies with mergers and acquisitions were down 22%, lower than what analysts expected."

"Global tech stocks and chipmakers rose in premarket trading Monday after the Trump administration published tariff exemptions on smartphones, computers, and other electronics — though Trump and his top officials muddied that message over the weekend, suggesting the reprieve would be temporary."
"As my colleague Jenny McCall details below, Apple (AAPL) was a top mover Monday morning, rising 5.5% on the exemptions. Apple also led global smartphone sales in the first quarter, according to Reuters, due to the iPhone 16e launch and strong demand in Japan and India."
"Best Buy (BBY), a tech retailer hard hit by tariffs, jumped over 8%, while Dell (DELL) rose 5%."
"US chipmakers Nvidia (NVDA) and Micron (MU) gained 3% and 5.4%, respectively. ASML (ASML), which produces chipmaking equipment, rose 1.5%, and Swiss electronics maker Logitech (LOGI) advanced 5.7%."
From Bloomberg:
Analysts warned that uncertainties around the tech sector remain high with new levies yet to be announced. Results due this week from ASML and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. will also be key as investors gauge the impact of tariffs on the supply chain for artificial intelligence chips.
"“The tariff environment is changing constantly. Semiconductors remain in limbo as we wait for the Section 301 investigation to finalize potential tariffs,” Barclays analyst Simon Coles said in a note."

Trump warns chip tariffs coming within a week after brief reprieve
The dollar (DX=F) fell to a six-month low as uncertainty over the Trump administration’s shifting tariff stance raised fears that investors could start pulling back from US assets.
Bloomberg News reports:
"The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was down 0.3% and earlier touched the lowest level since October. The gauge has slumped almost 6% this year amid escalating trade tensions with China, uncertainty over US policy and concern economic growth will slow."
"The dollar’s decline resumed after Trump said on Sunday he will still apply tariffs to phones, computers and popular consumer electronics, downplaying an earlier reprieve as a procedural step in his efforts to overhaul US trade. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” the president said in a social media post as trading began in Asia."

"Apple (AAPL) stock moved higher in premarket trading on Monday after the US granted temporary tariff exemptions on smartphones, computers, and other electronics. The move also lifted European tech stocks, with chipmakers like ASM International (ASM.AS), Infineon (IFX.DE), and ASML (ASML) — all heavily exposed to the US gaining."
"These firms supply key components for consumer electronics, and companies such as ASML (ASML), which make chipmaking equipment, are now excluded from Trump’s 10% baseline import duties."
Uncertainty still runs high as US President Donald Trump stated on Sunday that he plans to introduce tariffs on imported semiconductors and the entire supply chain within the coming week.

US stocks edged higher on Monday as investors focused on tech's temporary reprieve from President Trump's tariffs.
"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) trimmed bigger gains to rise a healthy 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) also closed off its session high, up 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up around 0.7%, or more than 300 points."
"Trump and his top advisers have sowed confusion in recent days on the future of its tariffs on China and on specific sectors. Megacap tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) scored a significant victory over the weekend when it was revealed that the US had excluded smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics from tariffs."
"But on Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that those electronics would soon be covered under levies that he said would be separate from those imposed on specific countries."
"Trump himself added to the muddied message when he said in a lengthy Sunday post on social media that there was ""no exception"" for those products."
"""We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,"" he said."
"But the initial reprieve broadly lifted the mood: Apple (AAPL) shares gained more than 2% during Monday’s session, as its smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices were set to benefit. Meanwhile, US automakers Ford (F) and GM (GM) stocks rose as Trump hinted he may also consider a carve out for upcoming auto tariffs."
"Yet Wall Street remains braced for another week of potential tariff-fueled ups and downs. The major indexes had their best week since at least 2023 last week, though it came in anything but conventional fashion."
"Traditional ""safe-haven"" assets have come in particular focus in recent days, as longer-term Treasury yields have surged while the US dollar has weakened against foreign currencies. Yields on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) fell below 4.36% Monday, while the US dollar (DX=F) fell."
"Meanwhile, investors will continue to hear from companies this week on the early impact of the tariffs. Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS) gained after the bank's profits jumped last quarter."
"The major averages edged higher but closed off their session highs on Monday as investors digested the most recent tariff exemptions, which include smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics."
"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.8 %, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) jumped 0.6%, trimming gains of more than 2% during the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 0.7%, or over 300 points."
Apple (AAPL) trimmed earlier gains but rose more than 2% as Wall Street viewed the iPhone maker as a top beneficiary of tariff exemptions revealed over the weekend.

The news was a surprise to Wall Street but not enough to significantly impact the stock. Pfizer's stock traded mostly flat in early Monday.
"""From here, while we anticipate shares to be down modestly, we do not think the Street was assigning any meaningful value to the asset and see limited downside given the company's current valuation,"" JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott wrote in a note to clients Monday."
"Pfizer has been under pressure to find a new blockbuster in its pipeline to fill the expected revenue drop from some of its key drugs going off patent by the end of the decade. That includes its Prevnar 13 vaccine next year and cancer drug Ibrance in 2028. Both brought in a combined $10.8 billion in 2024, with the Prevnar vaccines contributing $6.4 billion."

Apple (AAPL) shares gained as much as 5% on Monday as Wall Street viewed the iPhone maker a major winner of exemptions on tariffs announced by the Trump administration over the weekend.
"""The Trump administration gives AAPL a lifeline,"" said Angelo Zino, vice president and senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. ""It also provides a huge sigh of relief for US consumers who feared a significant increase in costs."""
"In a big win for the technology sector, the White House carved out reciprocal tariff exemptions on smartphones, computers, memory chips, tablets/smartwatches, chip equipment, and other electronics."
"""AAPL is clearly the biggest winner across the Technology space, avoiding a worst case scenario,"" said Zino."
"Apple shares are still down 15% year to date. The stock has been volatile since President Trump's reciprocal tariff announcement on April 2. Shares subsequently climbed higher after Trump announced a 90-day pause on many countries, but increased levies on China."
"Analysts had warned of significantly higher-priced iPhones if tariffs on China remained in place. Despite the exemption, CFRA's Zino says Apple must continue to think about diversifying its manufacturing out of China."

Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan outlines the key arguments and what's at stake:

Trump warns chip tariffs coming within a week after brief reprieve
The dollar (DX=F) fell to a six-month low as uncertainty over the Trump administration’s shifting tariff stance raised fears that investors could start pulling back from US assets.
Bloomberg News reports:
"The Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was down 0.3% and earlier touched the lowest level since October. The gauge has slumped almost 6% this year amid escalating trade tensions with China, uncertainty over US policy and concern economic growth will slow."
"The dollar’s decline resumed after Trump said on Sunday he will still apply tariffs to phones, computers and popular consumer electronics, downplaying an earlier reprieve as a procedural step in his efforts to overhaul US trade. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” the president said in a social media post as trading began in Asia."

"Apple (AAPL) stock moved higher in premarket trading on Monday after the US granted temporary tariff exemptions on smartphones, computers, and other electronics. The move also lifted European tech stocks, with chipmakers like ASM International (ASM.AS), Infineon (IFX.DE), and ASML (ASML) — all heavily exposed to the US gaining."
"These firms supply key components for consumer electronics, and companies such as ASML (ASML), which make chipmaking equipment, are now excluded from Trump’s 10% baseline import duties."
Uncertainty still runs high as US President Donald Trump stated on Sunday that he plans to introduce tariffs on imported semiconductors and the entire supply chain within the coming week.

US stocks edged higher on Monday as investors focused on tech's temporary reprieve from President Trump's tariffs.
"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) trimmed bigger gains to rise a healthy 0.8%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) also closed off its session high, up 0.6%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up around 0.7%, or more than 300 points."
"Trump and his top advisers have sowed confusion in recent days on the future of its tariffs on China and on specific sectors. Megacap tech companies like Nvidia (NVDA) and Apple (AAPL) scored a significant victory over the weekend when it was revealed that the US had excluded smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics from tariffs."
"But on Sunday, US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said that those electronics would soon be covered under levies that he said would be separate from those imposed on specific countries."
"Trump himself added to the muddied message when he said in a lengthy Sunday post on social media that there was ""no exception"" for those products."
"""We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,"" he said."
"But the initial reprieve broadly lifted the mood: Apple (AAPL) shares gained more than 2% during Monday’s session, as its smartphones, computers, and other electronic devices were set to benefit. Meanwhile, US automakers Ford (F) and GM (GM) stocks rose as Trump hinted he may also consider a carve out for upcoming auto tariffs."
"Yet Wall Street remains braced for another week of potential tariff-fueled ups and downs. The major indexes had their best week since at least 2023 last week, though it came in anything but conventional fashion."
"Traditional ""safe-haven"" assets have come in particular focus in recent days, as longer-term Treasury yields have surged while the US dollar has weakened against foreign currencies. Yields on the 10-year Treasury (^TNX) fell below 4.36% Monday, while the US dollar (DX=F) fell."
"Meanwhile, investors will continue to hear from companies this week on the early impact of the tariffs. Shares of Goldman Sachs (GS) gained after the bank's profits jumped last quarter."
"The major averages edged higher but closed off their session highs on Monday as investors digested the most recent tariff exemptions, which include smartphones, computers, and other consumer electronics."
"The S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose 0.8 %, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq (^IXIC) jumped 0.6%, trimming gains of more than 2% during the session. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained more than 0.7%, or over 300 points."
Apple (AAPL) trimmed earlier gains but rose more than 2% as Wall Street viewed the iPhone maker as a top beneficiary of tariff exemptions revealed over the weekend.
Auto stocks also rose on Monday after President Trump told reporters he’s considering exemptions related to imported cars and parts to give manufacturers more time to set up shop in the US.
Yahoo Finance's Laura Bratton reports:
Palantir (PLTR) stock rose more than on Monday after NATO announced it had finalized the acquisition of an AI military system from the Denver-based defense tech firm.
"Details of the deal were not disclosed, but NATO said it would begin using Palantir’s technology — the Maven Smart System NATO (MSS NATO) — in the next 30 days. MSS uses AI to compile and analyze data for ""battlespace awareness and planning,"" including the identification of military targets."
Palantir stock had gained as much as 9% before forfeiting some of these gains in morning trade alongside a broader market decline.

Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports:
"President Trump's tariff policy proposals, tweaks, and temporary reprieves have left investors and economists scrambling to nail down the precise impacts of this overhaul of America's trade relationships."
But this series of revisions hasn't yet changed one clear implication of the president's policy proposals as they stand today: We're going back in time. Way back.
Current estimates of the effective tariff rate for all US imports range from 22% to 27%.
"The high end of this range would put tariffs above levels last seen in 1903. At the lowest, tariffs would be the highest since 1910."
Read more here.
Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Schonberger reports:
"Federal Reserve governor Chris Waller warned Monday that inflation could surge this year near 5% and economic growth could ""slow to a crawl"" if the effective tariff rate remains at 25%. He believes the central bank may need to cut interest rates to prevent a recession."
"The reason to ease monetary policy in that scenario is that a surge in tariff-related inflation could in fact be ""temporary,"" which would allow Waller to ""look through it and determine policy based on the underlying trend."" The Fed governor anticipates the impact on growth and employment could be longer lasting."
"""I can hear the howls already that this must be a mistake given what happened in 2021 and 2022,"" he noted Monday while delivering a speech in St. Louis, referring to a period when policymakers wrongly predicted that inflation during the COVID-19 pandemic would turn out to be transitory."

"President Trump's wish to bring down oil prices has so far gone his way, with crude oil futures hovering near four-year lows."
And some on Wall Street think prices have a lot further to fall before the administration would be motivated to step in to support oil markets the way cascading bond prices may have been the catalyst for a 'Trump put' in the form of a pause on tariffs.
"""The price floor is now much lower,"" wrote JPMorgan head of global commodities strategy Natasha Kaneva and her team on Monday."
"""Unlike the Biden administration, which limited downside risk by guiding the refill of the US SPR [Strategic Petroleum Reserve] when WTI prices fell below $70, the Trump administration is actively pursuing lower oil prices, with intervention unlikely unless price drops to $50."""
"That would imply about a 20% drop in oil prices from current levels, as West Texas Intermediate (CL=F) crude oil prices, the US benchmark, hovered near $61 per barrel on Monday. Brent (BZ=F) crude oil, the international benchmark, sat just below $65 a barrel."

"Housing stocks have struggled this year as mortgage rates ride a roller coaster amid Trump’s sweeping tariff plans. However, according to Wedbush, that turbulence could offer a buying opportunity."
"“We would use the sell-off as a buying opportunity for builders that generate 50% or more of annual sales from move-up and active adult buyers since those buyers tend to be less rate-sensitive than entry-level buyers,” Jay McCanless, senior vice president of equity research, wrote in a note to clients."
"The latest policy moves from the administration have brought uncertainty to the market, affecting various sectors, including housing. But builders like Toll Brothers (TOL), Taylor Morrison (TMHC), PulteGroup (PHM), and M/I Homes (MHO) may be positioned to weather the storm as these builders target ""move-up"" and ""active adult"" segments, a buyer group that tends to be more resilient in a high interest rate environment."
"Mortgage rates have remained volatile this week, with some measures showing rates approaching 7%. While Trump has paused new tariffs on some trading partners, China’s levies remain very high, which continues to weigh down market sentiment."
"Shares of Toll Brothers, Inc. (TOL), D.R. Horton, Inc. (DHI), and Lennar Corporation (LEN) were mixed during Monday’s trading, with Toll down 0.8%, Lennar off by 0.1%, and D.R. Horton up 0.4%."
Auto stocks rose on Monday after President Trump told reporters he’s considering exemptions related to imported cars and parts to give manufacturers more time to set up shop in the US.
"""I’m looking at something to help car companies with it,"" Trump said. ""They’re switching to parts that were made in Canada, Mexico, and other places, and they need a little bit of time because they’re going to make them here."""
"Shares of GM (GM), Ford (F), and Stellantis (STLA), the parent company of Chrysler, all turned higher following the remarks."
The market rally on Monday faded by midday as the Nasdaq (^IXIC) erased almost a 2% gain to dip below the flat line.
"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) also trimmed gains, along with the S&P 500 (^GSPC). Some of the ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks, which had opened in the green, turned red."
"Meanwhile Apple (AAPL) pared gains of as much as 6%. By 12:10 p.m. ET, the stock was up only 2%."
"Amid ballooning tariff uncertainty, Wall Street isn't expecting to learn much about the 2025 outlook for American corporations during the current financial reporting period. Some companies have already pulled guidance for this year, and there's a looming question of how accurate any given guidance will end up being anyway as the tariff rate on various countries has proven to be a moving target."
But DataTrek co-founder Nicholas Colas argued in a research note on Monday that the amount with which S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies top earnings expectations this quarter will still be an insightful metric to gauge where in the cycle the stock market sits.
"Colas's work shows that, on average, S&P 500 companies beat expectations by 6% in bull markets. As the chart below shows, the average beat tumbled in the recent 2022 bear market, hitting a five-year low of 1.3% in the fourth quarter of 2022."
"""As much as 2025 earnings guidance (or, perhaps, lack thereof) will be important during the upcoming US Q1 financial reporting season, reported results will also provide useful information about underlying corporate profitability and management confidence,"" Colas wrote. ""The 'tell' will be by how much companies beat Wall Street analysts’ expectations."""
Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal reports:
"Unemployment concerns are on the rise among American workers as fears about the labor market in March reached levels last seen during the pandemic, according to a new survey released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Monday."
"The NY Fed's survey showed mean unemployment expectations among respondents — or the mean probability that the US unemployment rate will be higher one year from now — jumped 4.6 percentage points to 44% last month, the highest level since April 2020."
"The average expected likelihood of becoming unemployed in the next 12 months increased by 1.6 percentage points in March to 15.7%, the highest level since March 2024. The increase was largest for respondents with annual household incomes below $50,000."

"The dollar’s decline resumed after Trump said on Sunday he will still apply tariffs to phones, computers and popular consumer electronics, downplaying an earlier reprieve as a procedural step in his efforts to overhaul US trade. “NOBODY is getting ‘off the hook,’” the president said in a social media post as trading began in Asia."

"Apple (AAPL) stock moved higher in premarket trading on Monday after the US granted temporary tariff exemptions on smartphones, computers, and other electronics. The move also lifted European tech stocks, with chipmakers like ASM International (ASM.AS), Infineon (IFX.DE), and ASML (ASML) — all heavily exposed to the US gaining."
"These firms supply key components for consumer electronics, and companies such as ASML (ASML), which make chipmaking equipment, are now excluded from Trump’s 10% baseline import duties."
Uncertainty still runs high as US President Donald Trump stated on Sunday that he plans to introduce tariffs on imported semiconductors and the entire supply chain within the coming week.

Stocks ended last week higher after a turbulent week of fresh tariff headlines driving the market action.
"But even after the S&P 500's (^GSPC) best week in over a year, the benchmark index is still down 6% since President Trump's April 2 tariff announcement. Meanwhile the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) and Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) are off roughly 5% in the same period."
"This week, any incremental news on tariffs will be in focus. On Saturday news of exemptions on tariffs to China spread. Key products such as smartphones, laptop computers, hard drives and computer processors and memory chips were believed to not be subject to the tariffs, providing a potential boost to tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA)."
"But on Sunday, Trump disputed that report, saying there was no tariff exemption announced on Friday. He wrote on Truth Social that those products are ""subject to the existing 20% Fentanyl Tariffs, and they are just moving to a different Tariff 'bucket.""'"
"""We are taking a look at Semiconductors and the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN in the upcoming National Security Tariff Investigations,"" Trump wrote."
"Quarterly financial reports from a slew of American corporates will also be top of mind for investors. Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), Citi (C), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), and Netflix (NFLX) are expected to provide updates."
"On the economic data front, investors will be closely tracking an update on monthly retail sales for March due out on Wednesday."
Markets will be closed on Friday for Good Friday.
"Last Wednesday, Trump announced a 90-day pause on many ""reciprocal"" tariffs. Markets soared with the Nasdaq Composite rising over 12% for its second-best day on record."
"A day later, the White House confirmed that the total tariffs on China will now be 145% when accounting for the previous 20% duties already in place. The news came as a surprise to the market as President Trump had posted on Truth Social on Wednesday that the tariff rate charged to China would be 125%. The Nasdaq tumbled 4.3% in reaction."
"Overall, the estimated effective tariff rate has moved from 22.5% on April 2 to 27% after the latest China levies, per the Yale Budget Lab."

"With the US's exact landing spot on tariffs remaining a moving target, Wall Street strategists believe that recent developments show tariff uncertainty will remain a key driver of market action in the weeks ahead."
"""Overall, we're kind of still where we were,"" Brent Schutte, Northwestern Mutual Wealth Management Company's chief investment officer, told Yahoo Finance on Thursday. ""Certainly, some of the tension has come off the boil, but there's still a lot of uncertainty out there. And to me, uncertainty means that people are more indecisive, CEOs and consumers alike. And that is the risk going forward in the next 90 days."""
Trump's tariff back-and-forth has economists arguing the risks of recession have been rising. The fear is a combination of higher prices and that overall uncertainty about policy could slow US economic growth. The recession debate comes as economic growth data has been largely weaker than expected in the start to 2025.
"A closely tracked consumer spending metric is set for release on Wednesday. The March retail sales report is expected to show sales increased 1.4% in March, up from a 0.2% increase the month prior. Excluding the volatile auto and gas, retail sales are expected to have grown 0.4%."
"""Big-ticket spending in March and April could see a surge as consumers pull forward those purchases before tariffs take a significant bite,"" the Wells Fargo economics team led by Jay Bryson wrote in a note to clients on Friday. ""After that, however, we are likely to see a weak consumer spending performance in the second half of the year."""
"First quarter earnings reports trickled in last week with uncertainty at the forefront of companies messaging. Delta Air Lines (DAL) pulled its full-year guidance amid what CEO Ed Bastian told Yahoo Finance is a ""murky"" outlook."
"JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said the economy is facing ""considerable turbulence."" Meanwhile, BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said that ""uncertainty and anxiety about the future of markets and the economy are dominating client conversations."""
Strategists expect this to be a continued theme as earnings reports roll on this week.
"""It's the murkiest environment you could be in outside of a pandemic,"" Charles Schwab senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon told Yahoo Finance. ""We're kind of entering back into that sort of environment where there's probably going to be no guidance on the aggregate level, and companies ... they can't tell us what's going to happen."""
A rapid bond market sell-off has added another headwind to the bull case for stocks.
"The 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) soared last week, logging its largest weekly gain since November 2021. At times over the past two years, a rise in the 10-year has become a key driver of stocks' decline, particularly when the yield rises above 4.5%. At the current moment, the massive spike and increase in rate volatility appears to be the main concern among investors."
"Piper Sandler chief investment strategist Michael Kantrowitz told Yahoo Finance the bond market action is a ""new negative"" in the market narrative."
"""It kind of creates this new variable that could add to the volatility during the day, when there's not headline news,"" Kantrowitz said while also noting regularly scheduled Treasury auctions could now be stock market moving events."
"He added, ""Really simply, interest rates going up at a time where there's clearly a growth scare and a recession scare and a great deal of uncertainty is just bad news period."""
"And with a variety of factors potentially driving the sell-off, investors don't think the chaos in the bond market is ending anytime soon."
"""We're going to be in an elevated volatility environment for the time being, which is one reason why we like raising some cash in our portfolios, just to generate some flexibility,"" David Rogal, lead portfolio manager of the BlackRock Total Return Fund (MAHQX), told Yahoo Finance."
